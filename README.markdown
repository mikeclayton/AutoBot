# AutoBot
AutoBot is inspired by GitHub's splendid [HUBOT](http://hubot.github.com/) and a childhood love of [Transformers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobot), AutoBot however is a chat bot for the Windows crew. 

+ The core bot engine is written in C# (.NET 4), his functionality and extensibility is provided by the addition of PowerShell 2.0 script modules which are dynamically loaded and executed at runtime.
+ AutoBot currently chats only with the [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/) powered awesomeness that is [HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com) using the [jabber-net](http://code.google.com/p/jabber-net/) library
